This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


<!-- * Endpoints for GET (all and by id), POST, PUT and DELETE. -->

* A RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park/business/animal.

<!-- * A second custom endpoint that accepts parameters (example: a SEARCH route that allows users to search by specific park names). -->

<!-- * Model scopes should be used to process parameters from API calls. -->

* At least one of the objectives from Monday's Further Exploration lesson (such as versioning, token authentication, or serialization).

<!-- * Thorough exception handling. -->

* Complete testing with request specs.

<!-- * Randomized data with Faker or your own custom seed code. -->

* A README that thoroughly documents all endpoints, including parameters that can be passed in.
